# Landsale

We have a landsale dataset which contains 150000 land coordinations, and we want to find four-quadrant population taking land coordinations as ogrigins and draw rectangular coordinates to intersect the cityborder. We download an asc file from nasa website which cut the whole world in many small rasters and contains population information in each of them. 


Datasource: https://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/set/gpw-v4-population-count-rev11 


Then we transform it into a dta file.
We also have a dataset contains all the cityborder coordinations of China, and we use these three datasets to finish the work.
